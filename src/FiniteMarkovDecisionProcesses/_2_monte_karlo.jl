    mk_evaluate_policy!(V, Q, mdp, policy, γ; tol, maxiter)

Evaluates (deterministic or stochastic) decision policy `policy` for the given Markov
decision process `mdp` and given discount factor `γ`.

By saying that a policy has been "evaluated", we imply that state values `V` and 
state-action values `Q` are computed for this policy. This function evaluates policies in-place,
approximately, in an iterrative manner, until maximal difference between state values in consequtive 
iterations is less than the specified `tol`, or until a maximal number of iterations `maxiter` 
is performed.

The function returns a 2-tuple containing: the number of iterations performed, and a boolean 
indicator of convergence (which is `true` if the vector of state values is evaluated with the 
required precission, and `false` otherwise).
